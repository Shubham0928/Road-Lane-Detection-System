# Road-Lane-Detection-System
# Introduction
Road lane line detection is a crucial task for autonomous driving to ensure safe and efficient 
transportation. Road lane line detection using Machine Learning (ML) algorithms has gained 
significant attention in recent years due to its effectiveness in accurately detecting lane lines 
on roads.
The ML algorithms used for road lane line detection include semantic segmentation, Hough 
Transform, and Template Matching. These algorithms enable autonomous vehicles to detect 
lane lines, stay within their lanes, and avoid accidents.
In this report, we will explore the techniques used for road lane line detection using ML and 
their applications. The advancements in ML algorithms and hardware will continue to improve 
road lane line detection, making transportation systems safer and more efficient
